The tea-dragon of Angwark.

The Tea-dragon of Angwark is a concept in British software engineering about how one cup of tea equals roughly ten lines of code. 

It is generally attributed to sir Devon of Angwark.

Basically, the amount of tea consumed in a British office is an approximate indication of the level of coding efficiency.
